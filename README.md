# Image_Classification_Multiclass
The aim of this project is to build an image classifier that categorize images of airplanes,motorbikes and schooners into their respective classes. 

The dataset is obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maricinnamon/caltech101-airplanes-motorbikes-schooners

The dataset consists of 3 folders representing
1. Motorcycles
2. Schooners
3. Airplanes

PROJECT DESIGN

The project is divided into 7 phases namely, 
Libraries and Variables
Data
Pre-processing
Neural Network Architecture - VGG16
Training and Saving the best model
Visualizing the obtained results in terms of Loss and Accuracy
Testing
